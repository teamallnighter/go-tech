Opportunities for Engagement in Research and Development

The GO Tech Foundation recognizes the talent and knowledge of post-secondary students and has a high regard for the value of experiential and practical post-secondary education. The GO Student program provides opportunities for students to apply their skill sets and interests within a multi-disciplinary Organization. These experiences help to frame studentsâ€™ studies in the context of community and global issues, preparing them to take on the challenge of creating and implementing solutions.

In the past few years, GO has supported teams of students from finance, marketing, and engineering to work on various projects related to their studies. GO has worked with business students from [Alliance in Marketing](http://www.alliancesinmarketing.com/) and the [Haskayne Consulting Club.](https://haskayneconsulting.wordpress.com/) Back in 2018, GO sponsored a University of Calgary Engineering Capstone project to develop wireless mesh networking capabilities for the IDI micro-inverter, to communicate real-time data to both consumer and administrative interfaces.

Currently, GO is supporting the following student initiatives and groups:
